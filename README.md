# FM-SC
FileMaker Script Chronograph

## Outline
FileMaker - Script Chronograph (FM-SC) is a script execution time measurement system to check the performance of your scripts when developing custom FileMaker Apps. Since the measured data can be saved as a database, it is possible to compare the same script under different environments. The system displays the mean and unbiased standard deviation as statistics, but it also keeps the raw data, so you can export the data for analysis in Excel.
